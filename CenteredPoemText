         Once the guest of the musician.


          I was perpetually observing.


             The woman in the pews.


       She, a pianist from a foreign land.


        I sat among the others to witness


           this woman at the Steinway.


 Her entire body tumbled through her fingertips


summoning Beethoven’s symphony no. 6 in F major.


the awakening, the brook, the country folk. . . .






   Finally, in the thunderstorm, her bare arms


           channeling bolts, rumblings


        enough to shake entire timbers -


 I rise to become her—the woman at the Steinway


  simultaneously watching from under the eaves


        with my father who is teaching me


              to stand in a storm.


         It’s where I continue to stand


     because it’s where I’ve been all along.






           Then the poem came and you


      were sure to understand how I became


           The Woman at the Steinway.
