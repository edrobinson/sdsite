The old clock sighs in the quiet hall,
A lonely pendulum's patient call.
Dust motes dance in a sunlit stream,
A forgotten fragment of a waking dream.
The world outside is a distant hum,
For all the restless roads they've come.

A silent book on a cherry shelf,
Holds all the stories of itself.
Its pages whisper of ink and age,
A folded corner on a favorite page.
It waits for fingers, soft and slow,
To find the gardens where the words still grow.

The rain begins its gentle fall,
A rhythmic tapping on the stone wall.
It washes clean the pavement gray,
And carries all the blues away.
The city lights begin to bloom,
Chasing shadows from a lonely room.

A kettle whistles, sharp and bright,
A small rebellion against the night.
The steam ascends in a misty curl,
A simple magic in a complex world.
It fills the air with a soft perfume,
Dispelling all the gathering gloom.

And in the silence, a thought takes flight,
A quiet fire in the waning light.
A single moment, brief and true,
A simple something, fresh and new.
The old clock ticks, the rain still streams,
And life unfolds between the dreams.
