Through 43 poems that explore a variety of subjects including nature, social justice, emigration and immigration, relationships, art, and aging, the Live Poets speak as one supportive community. Three short essays suggest how diverse and varied writers may not only endure but also thrive! This unpredictable anthology is authored by nine Live Poets. Their spirit of collaboration is exemplified by the poems' unique presentation on the page. Poets' names don't appear until the final pages of the book. This arrangement focuses the reader's attention on the continuity of the sequence of poems rather than on the authorship of the poems. Readers will also discover an elegant give-and-take model of communication in the Preface and the Editor's Remarks. The imaginative reader may decide to apply this communication model in any community.These poets have broadly based interests and backgrounds, including three public school teachers, a retired pastor whose youth was spent in New Guinea, a former professor of culture and literacy, a former global nomad who is also a lawyer, a scientist who is also a jeweler, a retired Executive Director of the Idaho Zoological Society, and a Jamaican caregiver who recently became a naturalized US citizen. Also included are the poems of two Live Poets who are deceased-one a former investment firm's operations manager and the other a former Idaho State Supreme Court justice.Cohesive for over 25 years, the Live Poets Society has given readings at libraries, bookstores, an art museum and a theater in Boise, Idaho, USA. Through public readings and publications, the Live Poets strive to encourage an appreciation of poetry within the community. </p>
