                  I wonder. . .
                   if identity
            might have a belly button.
     
                Is the pearl of me
    (surrounded by exterior, shell and muscle)
          tethered to something silent?
       something essential and everywhere?
     
            Watching events take shape
       safely accepting decay and evolution
          this pearl could turn a world
                   inside out.
