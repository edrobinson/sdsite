Through 43 poems that explore a variety of subjects including nature, social justice, emigration and immigration, relationships, art, and aging, the Live Poets speak as one supportive community.  Three short essays suggest how diverse and varied writers may not only endure but also thrive!<br/><br/> 

This unpredictable anthology is authored by nine Live Poets. Their spirit of collaboration is exemplified by the poems’ unique presentation on the page.  Poets’ names don’t appear until the final pages of the book.  This arrangement focuses the reader’s attention on the continuity of the sequence of poems rather than on the authorship of the poems.  Readers will also discover an elegant give-and-take model of communication in the Preface and the Editor’s Remarks.  The imaginative reader may decide to apply this communication model in any community.<br/><br/>

These poets have broadly based interests and backgrounds, including three public school teachers, a retired pastor whose youth was spent in New Guinea, a former professor of culture and literacy, a former global nomad who is also a lawyer, a scientist who is also a jeweler, a retired Executive Director of the Idaho Zoological Society, and a Jamaican caregiver who recently became a naturalized US citizen.  Also included are the poems of two Live Poets who are deceased—one a former investment firm’s operations manager and the other a former Idaho State Supreme Court justice.<br/><br/>

Cohesive for over 25 years, the Live Poets Society has given readings at libraries, bookstores, an art museum and a theater in Boise, Idaho, USA.  Through public readings and publications, the Live Poets strive to encourage an appreciation of poetry within the community.

Dance is the first art I ever loved.  Its essence is energy, the lightness of being.  Poetry — the art of dancing with thoughts and words —sustains me in my middle years.  When Kelli proposed a dance/poetry collaboration responding to the Boise Art Museum’s origami exhibit, I felt she was on to something good.  Time, like our 30-year friendship. Would tell.  Kelli began enthusiastically offering many possibilities to perform and display poetry with her choreography:  readings, paper print, even screen projections.  Sketches of Angela Rockefeller’s costumes appeared.  Poets observed dance rehearsal video clips.  And the poetry began to surface.  When the Boise Art Museum’s International collection of origami came to town, poets attended.  More poems surfaced.  As poets watched dance rehearsals, more poems came to light.  Although not every Live Poet contributed responsive works, everyone gave feedback on early drafts and encouragement.  Jamie Armstrong’s measured approach and good judgement served us all.  He guided our collaboration on this book.  And his spontaneous back-stage yo-yo performance delighted and untied the entire dance-poetry crew out of pre-performance jitters the night we sold out at the Boise Art Museum.  Finally, I knew we’d done something good when the children from Valley View Elementary folded 1000 cranes for the spring shows at the Boise Contemporary Theatre.  They wished that the sick may be healed.  Based on this project’s history, the odds are favorable.

This book is a poetry-prose memoir about the 18 months I spent living near Seoul, South Korea, with my husband and two school-aged children who attended international school.  Insights about cultural transitions may be useful to families who are going to (or returning from) a new culture for a least one semester, and in which the language of the new culture is not familiar.
