### Site Administration Help  
  
A website is not a static thing. Changes and additions to the imformation provided  
by the site are inevitable. In light of this, a number of "editor" pages are provided.  

#### How the information is stored:   
The mutable (changeable) information is stored in a "database". A database is made  
up "tables." Each table is similar to an Excel spreadsheet with rows and columns.  
Each table contains information for a single subject. For instance, a table named  
"books" contains information about each of your books to be displayed on the   
books page of the site. Each row in the table describes one book. Each book is  
defined by columns like name, author, description, cover image name and price.  
   
#### Accessing the editors:  
 
 The image below is of adminstration page. The big blue buttons are links to an  
 editor page for the table named in the button. Click the button for the table you  
 want to work with and iot's editor page will be displayed.
