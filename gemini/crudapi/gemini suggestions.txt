Important Notes for your Flask Backend:

For the JavaScript code above to work, your Flask backend needs to expose the following API endpoints:

POST /api/items: To create a new record. (Expects JSON body, returns JSON of new record)

GET /api/items: To read all records. (Returns JSON array of records)

GET /api/items/<id>: To read a specific record by ID. (Returns JSON of the record)

PUT /api/items/<id>: To update a specific record by ID. (Expects JSON body, returns JSON of updated record)

DELETE /api/items/<id>: To delete a specific record by ID. (Returns 204 No Content or a simple success message)
